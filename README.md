## Project Overview

[TODO] Outline high level project architecture and technical decisions.

## Running the Application

[TODO] Instructions for running the compiled application will go here.

## Development

This application is built using [Dart](https://dart.dev). The easiest way to install Dart on a Mac is using homebrew.

```sh
brew tap dart-lang/dart
brew install dart
```

This application requires Dart SDK version 2.16.1 or higher.

### Dependencies

Dart's default package manager is [pub](https://pub.dev/). Once Dart is installed, you can initialize the project's
dependencies by running:

```sh
dart pub install
```

Project dependencies are managed in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Tests

To run the test suite, ensure you have Dart and all project dependencies installed (see above), and then run:

```sh
dart test
```
